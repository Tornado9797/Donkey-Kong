# Donkey Kong
A Scratch port of the first level of the original Donkey Kong arcade game, made late 2012.

## Premise
This was my midterm project for my 9th grade computer science class, and additionally my final Scratch project for that class. This is by far the largest and most complex Scratch project I've ever made. It's too bad that, due to time constraints, I could only complete the first level.

## Usage Instructions
The following is an excerpt from the game's intro screen:
"This is the project I am designing for my Scratch Application: Donkey Kong."  
"Use the left and right arrow keys to move, left and right respectivley. Tap the up arrow key to climb up ladders that aren't broken, tap the down arrow key to climb down ladders that aren't broken."  
"Use the space bar to jump. Jumping over a barrel will give you anywhere from 75 to 150 points."  
"Get to the highest platform to win, you also get however much Bonus is left added to your point system."  
"You only have 1 life in this version, you can be killed by running out of time (Bonus), or touching a barrel. Once you are killed, you will get a Game Over."  
"In case of emergency abort, hit the x button."

## Legal
"Donky Kong" and all related properties are owned by Nintendo. All visuals that are not Jumpman or Donkey Kong were made by me.
